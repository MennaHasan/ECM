# ECM

This project is part of my thesis research on fault tolerant sensors. Our research resulted in a design that will enhance the performance of sensors while reducing costs and to implement this idea we used FPGA. 

The project is programmed using VHDL

This code is written by Salwa Sadek, and Myself Menatalla Hassan and thesis is under the supervision of Dr. Hasaneen Amer
